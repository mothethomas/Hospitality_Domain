## Project Title

Revenue Insights in Hospitality Domain

## Problem Statement

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing their market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue.

## Description

This project involves creating a dashboard to provide meaningful insights into the revenue performance of AtliQ Grands hotels. The dashboard helps in visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends, which can be used by the management team to make informed decisions and strategic moves.
